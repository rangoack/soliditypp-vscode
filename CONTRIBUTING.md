# Contributing

## Introduction

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing. All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. 

This VS Code extension does 2 things:
* Compile smart contracts
* Deploy smart contracts and interact with smart contracts

This extension UI based on [vscode webview ui toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit) and [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org).

## Project Setup

So you wanna contribute some code! Great! Read [how to build extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) if you've never done it before.

If you want to go the usual route and run the project locally, though:
* [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

then in your terminal:
* Fork this project `git clone git@github.com:vitelabs/soliditypp-vscode.git` 
* Install dependencies `npm run install:all`
* Build project `npm run build:all` or `npm run watch:all`
* Open in VS code `code .`, then press F5 in VS Code

And your should be ready to go!

## Contribute Code

We like code commits a lot! Code contributions of just about any size are acceptable.
